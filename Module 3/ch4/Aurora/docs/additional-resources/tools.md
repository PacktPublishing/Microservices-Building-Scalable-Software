Various tools integrate with Aurora. Is there a tool missing? Let us know, or submit a patch to add it!

* Load-balancing technology used to direct traffic to services running on Aurora:
  - [synapse](https://github.com/airbnb/synapse) based on HAProxy
  - [aurproxy](https://github.com/tellapart/aurproxy) based on nginx
  - [jobhopper](https://github.com/benley/aurora-jobhopper) performs HTTP redirects for easy developer and administrator access

  - [scales](https://github.com/steveniemitz/scales) (Python)

* Monitoring:
  - [collectd-aurora](https://github.com/zircote/collectd-aurora) for cluster monitoring using collectd
  - [Prometheus Aurora exporter](https://github.com/tommyulfsparre/aurora_exporter) for cluster monitoring using Prometheus
  - [Prometheus service discovery integration](http://prometheus.io/docs/operating/configuration/#zookeeper-serverset-sd-configurations-serverset_sd_config) for discovering and monitoring services running on Aurora
