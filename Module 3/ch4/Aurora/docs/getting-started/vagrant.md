A local Cluster with Vagrant
============================

This document shows you how to configure a complete cluster using a virtual machine. This setup
replicates a real cluster in your development machine as closely as possible. After you complete
the steps outlined here, you will be ready to create and run your first Aurora job.

Overview
--------

The Aurora distribution includes a set of scripts that enable you to create a local cluster in
your development machine. These scripts use [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) to run and configure a virtual machine. Once the
virtual machine is running, the scripts install and initialize Aurora and any required components
to create the local cluster.


Install VirtualBox and Vagrant
------------------------------

First, download and install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) on your development machine.

Then download and install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/). To verify that the installation
was successful, open a terminal window and type the `vagrant` command. You should see a list of
common commands for this tool.


Clone the Aurora repository
---------------------------

To obtain the Aurora source distribution, clone its Git repository using the following command:

     git clone git://git.apache.org/aurora.git


Start the local cluster
-----------------------

Now change into the `aurora/` directory, which contains the Aurora source code and
other scripts and tools:

     cd aurora/

To start the local cluster, type the following command:

     vagrant up

This command uses the configuration scripts in the Aurora distribution to:

* Download a Linux system image.
* Start a virtual machine (VM) and configure it.
* Install the required build tools on the VM.
* Install Aurora's requirements (like [Mesos](http://mesos.apache.org/) and
[Zookeeper](http://zookeeper.apache.org/)) on the VM.
* Build and install Aurora from source on the VM.
* Start Aurora's services on the VM.

This process takes several minutes to complete.

You may notice a warning that guest additions in the VM don't match your version of VirtualBox.
This should generally be harmless, but you may wish to install a vagrant plugin to take care of
mismatches like this for you:

     vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest

With this plugin installed, whenever you `vagrant up` the plugin will upgrade the guest additions
for you when a version mis-match is detected. You can read more about the plugin
[here](https://github.com/dotless-de/vagrant-vbguest).

To verify that Aurora is running on the cluster, visit the following URLs:

* Scheduler - http://192.168.33.7:8081
* Observer - http://192.168.33.7:1338
* Mesos Master - http://192.168.33.7:5050
* Mesos Slave - http://192.168.33.7:5051


Log onto the VM
---------------

To SSH into the VM, run the following command in your development machine:

     vagrant ssh

To verify that Aurora is installed in the VM, type the `aurora` command. You should see a list
of arguments and possible commands.

The `/vagrant` directory on the VM is mapped to the `aurora/` local directory
from which you started the cluster. You can edit files inside this directory in your development
machine and access them from the VM under `/vagrant`.

A pre-installed `clusters.json` file refers to your local cluster as `devcluster`, which you
will use in client commands.


Run your first job
------------------

Now that your cluster is up and running, you are ready to define and run your first job in Aurora.
For more information, see the [Aurora Tutorial](tutorial.md).


Rebuild components
------------------

If you are changing Aurora code and would like to rebuild a component, you can use the `aurorabuild`
command on the VM to build and restart a component.  This is considerably faster than destroying
and rebuilding your VM.

`aurorabuild` accepts a list of components to build and update. To get a list of supported
components, invoke the `aurorabuild` command with no arguments:

     vagrant ssh -c 'aurorabuild client'


Shut down or delete your local cluster
--------------------------------------

To shut down your local cluster, run the `vagrant halt` command in your development machine. To
start it again, run the `vagrant up` command.

Once you are finished with your local cluster, or if you would otherwise like to start from scratch,
you can use the command `vagrant destroy` to turn off and delete the virtual file system.


Troubleshooting
---------------

Most of the vagrant related problems can be fixed by the following steps:

* Destroying the vagrant environment with `vagrant destroy`
* Killing any orphaned VMs (see AURORA-499) with `virtualbox` UI or `VBoxManage` command line tool
* Cleaning the repository of build artifacts and other intermediate output with `git clean -fdx`
* Bringing up the vagrant environment with `vagrant up`
