# Scheduler Configuration Reference

The Aurora scheduler can take a variety of configuration options through command-line arguments.
A list of the available options can be seen by running `aurora-scheduler -help`.

Please refer to the [Operator Configuration Guide](../operations/configuration.md) for details on how
to properly set the most important options.
