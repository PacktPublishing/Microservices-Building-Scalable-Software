class BindingHelper(Interface):
  """A component which resolves some set of pseudo-bindings in a config.

  Many bindings are too complex to resolve with bindings using the standard mechanisms,
  because they require some python computation to determine how to bind them. For example,
  for references like {{jenkins[build]}}, we need to talk to Jenkins to get the build artifact URL.

  A BindingHelper is responsible for resolving one of these types of pseudo-bindings.
  BuildBindingHelper will resolve "build" bindings, JenkinsBindingHelper will resolve "jenkins"
  bindings, etc.

  A BindingHelper can be registered by calling "BindingHelper.register(Helper)". Instead of
  explicitly calling "inject" methods in populate_namespaces, it will compute the set of open
  bindings, and then call the appropriate helpers for each.

  The bindings can be computed either from scratch, or from a binding dictionary. A binding
  dictionary can be computed from live data, and then passed over an RPC connection, so that
  the bindings can be recomputed on the server.

  Each helper is responsible for computing its own binding dict. The data in the dict should
  meet two requirements: it should be enough data to allow it to produce exactly the same
  result as the scratch binding, and the data should provide information that makes the
  binding comprehensible for a human debugging a job.
