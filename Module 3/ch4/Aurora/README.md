![Aurora Logo](docs/images/aurora_logo.png)

[Apache Aurora](https://aurora.apache.org/) lets you use an [Apache Mesos](http://mesos.apache.org)
cluster as a private cloud. It supports running long-running services, cron jobs, and ad-hoc jobs.
Aurora aims to make it extremely quick and easy to take a built application and run it on machines
in a cluster, with an emphasis on reliability. It provides basic operations to manage services
running in a cluster, such as rolling upgrades.

To very concisely describe Aurora, it is like a distributed monit or distributed supervisord that
you can instruct to do things like _run 100 of these, somewhere, forever_.


## Features

Aurora is built for users _and_ operators.

* User-facing Features:
  - Management of [long-running services](docs/features/services.md)
  - [Cron jobs](docs/features/cron-jobs.md)
  - [Resource quotas](docs/features/multitenancy.md): provide guaranteed resources for specific
    applications
  - [Rolling job updates](docs/features/job-updates.md), with automatic rollback
  - [Multi-user support](docs/features/multitenancy.md)
  - Sophisticated [DSL](docs/reference/configuration-tutorial.md): supports templating, allowing you to
    establish common patterns and avoid redundant configurations
  - [Dedicated machines](docs/features/constraints.md#dedicated-attribute):
    for things like stateful services that must always run on the same machines
  - [Service registration](docs/features/service-discovery.md): announce services in
    [ZooKeeper](http://zookeeper.apache.org/) for discovery by [various clients](docs/additional-resources/tools.md)
  - [Scheduling constraints](docs/features/constraints.md)
    to run on specific machines, or to mitigate impact of issues like machine and rack failure

* Under the hood, to help you rest easy:
  - [Preemption](docs/features/multitenancy.md): important services can 'steal' resources when they need it
  - High-availability: resists machine failures and disk failures
  - Scalable: proven to work in data center-sized clusters, with hundreds of users and thousands of
    jobs
  - Instrumented: a wealth of information makes it easy to [monitor](docs/operations/monitoring.md)
    and debug

### When and when not to use Aurora
Aurora can take over for most uses of software like monit and chef.  Aurora can manage applications,
while these tools are still useful to manage Aurora and Mesos themselves.

However, if you have very specific scheduling requirements, or are building a system that looks like a
scheduler itself, you may want to explore developing your own
[framework](http://mesos.apache.org/documentation/latest/app-framework-development-guide).
