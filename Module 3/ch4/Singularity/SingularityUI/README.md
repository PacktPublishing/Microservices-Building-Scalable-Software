Singularity UI is a single page web app that uses Singularity API to: 
- Display information about active and historical requests and deploys and their underlying tasks
- Display task artifacts (the relevant application folder tree), tail and download task logs  
- Display slave hosts that are part of the Mesos Cluster and decommission them
- Pause and Delete registered deployable items (Singularity Requests)
- Check / Debug the API JSON payloads for requests, deploys, tasks and statuses
- Register / update the information of Deployable Items (i.e. post Singularity Requests)
- Execute Deploys (Post Deploy requests)
